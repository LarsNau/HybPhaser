Changelog


v.1.2 (2021-05-31)

Added functionality:

- generates txt file with list of included samples (useful for clade association)
- changed "extract_mapped_reads.sh" to work with BLASTX output
    Before it extracted mapped reads from the BWA files, now it collects all mapped read files from the gene subdirectories and concatenates the files. 
    It further generated R1 and R2 files for paired-end reads. 


Bugfixes:

- does not abort when no paralogs_for_all are removed (1b)
- fixed "no threshold_value found" (1b)
- fixed wrong plots in PDf for diverse levels of heterozygosity (1c)
- removed irreleant error messages from "'system("cat ...") ' (1d)
- fixed error involving wrong locus name with error message that stopped script (1d)
- fixed issue with combinging tables (2b)
- fixed that non-phased sequences of phased samples are removed from the combined alignment (4b)

Known issues:

- extract mapping reads script only works with BAM files from BWA mapping. When BLASTX is used the output file in blastx format has to be transformed to BAM first. (blast2bam)


v.1.1 (2021-02-20)

Added funtionality:

- Target file can be nucleotides or amino acid (fasta format). 
- Improved performance of Rscript_1d 
- Improve output of graphic for paralogous loci for all (1c)
  
Bug fixes:    

- fixed bug with read names in paird-end mode (2b)
- fixed bug with file name recognition (2b)
- reads correct Summary table (2b)
- fixed bug, now it gets the correct folder (3a)
- corrected numbers in graph for n loci, and n samples (1b)
- save table as R object with correct file ending (1c)
- empty only subfolder to start clean (1d)
